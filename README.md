# Lab-5.2-Deploying-Active-Directory
In this home lab, I will install Active Directory Domain Services, set up a forest as mydomain.com, and use Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) to create and assign users to connect to VM-Client-1 via Remote Desktop (RDP). I will also be using Powershell ISE to run a script that creates randomized users to be able to connect to client-1.
